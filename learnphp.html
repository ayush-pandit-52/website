                <h2>Static Websites</h2>
                <p class="sol">Static websites are built with fixed content that doesn’t change dynamically when a user
                    interacts with it. They’re made using HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript to display information,
                    but they don’t require a backend server or database, making them lightweight and fast.</p>

                <h2>Key Features:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fixed Content:</strong> Content is pre-built and doesn’t change based on user input.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>No Backend Needed:</strong> Doesn’t require a server or database.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fast Loading:</strong> Static sites load quickly since they only need to fetch the
                        content and design from files, not a database.</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy to Host:</strong> They can be hosted anywhere, from GitHub Pages to Netlify, with
                        minimal setup.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Benefits:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Low Cost:</strong> Hosting is often free or inexpensive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Without a backend, there’s less risk of database hacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Fast loading times due to fewer server requests.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Use Cases:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Portfolio websites</li>
                    <li>Documentation pages</li>
                    <li>Blogs (with static site generators)</li>
                    <li>Company landing pages</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Tools for Creating Static Sites:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTML & CSS:</strong> Basic building blocks of a static site.</li>
                    <li><strong>Static Site Generators:</strong> Tools like Jekyll, Hugo, and Gatsby that convert
                        content into static HTML pages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deployment Platforms:</strong> Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="note">If you’re planning to build a simple site for something like CodeWhere, a static setup
                    might work
                    well unless you need user interaction or real-time updates.</p>

            <section class="phpcontent">
                <h2>Dynamic Websites</h2>
                <p>Dynamic websites are built to display content that changes in response to user interactions or other
                    factors, like time or location. They rely on both front-end and back-end technologies to fetch and
                    display up-to-date information, making them ideal for more complex applications requiring user
                    engagement and interaction.</p>

                <h2>Key Features:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Content:</strong> Content changes based on user input or other variables.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Backend Required:</strong> Requires a server and often a database to process and serve
                        content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data-Driven:</strong> Content can be dynamically generated based on data from databases
                        or APIs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personalized Experience:</strong> Users can have personalized content, such as account
                        information, recommendations, or messages.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Benefits:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User Engagement:</strong> Dynamic websites offer interactive features, increasing user
                        engagement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Suitable for applications that need regular updates, like news,
                        e-commerce, or social media platforms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Tailored content based on user preferences, increasing
                        relevance and engagement.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Use Cases:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Online stores</li>
                    <li>Social media platforms</li>
                    <li>Content management systems (e.g., WordPress)</li>
                    <li>Interactive web applications (e.g., Google Docs, project management tools)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Technologies for Building Dynamic Sites:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Server-Side Languages:</strong> PHP, Node.js, Python (e.g., Django, Flask), Ruby, Java
                        (e.g., Spring).</li>

                    <li><strong>Front-End Frameworks:</strong> React, Vue, Angular for creating dynamic user interfaces.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>APIs:</strong> Allows data exchange between the server and client for real-time updates.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="note">Dynamic websites are best suited for applications that need frequent content updates,
                    real-time data, or user-specific experiences. If CodeWhere is expected to have personalized features
                    or interactions, a dynamic site approach may be ideal.</p>

                <h2>Introduction to Web Servers</h2>
                <p>A web server is a system that hosts, processes, and delivers web content to users. When users access
                    a website through a browser, their requests are sent to a web server, which processes them and
                    returns the necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) to display the requested web
                    pages.</p>

                <h2>Key Functions of a Web Server:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hosting Content:</strong> Web servers store website files and make them accessible over
                        the internet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Handling Requests:</strong> They receive HTTP requests from clients (browsers) and
                        respond with the appropriate resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Web servers can provide security features like SSL encryption to
                        protect data during transmission.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> They manage network traffic, bandwidth, and resources to
                        ensure smooth performance.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Examples of Web Servers:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Apache HTTP Server:</strong> An open-source server known for its stability, flexibility,
                        and popularity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nginx:</strong> Known for its performance, it is widely used for handling high-traffic
                        sites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Microsoft IIS:</strong> Internet Information Services, a server designed for Windows
                        environments.</li>
                    <li><strong>LiteSpeed:</strong> A performance-focused server, often used as an alternative to
                        Apache.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How a Web Server Works:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Request:</strong> The browser sends a request for a specific page or resource (e.g.,
                        <code>example.com</code>) via HTTP/HTTPS.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Processing:</strong> The server receives the request, locates the requested file, and
                        processes any necessary server-side scripts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Response:</strong> The server responds with the requested file, which the browser then
                        displays as a webpage.</li>
                </ol>
                <img src="web-servers.png" alt="">
                <h2>Benefits of Using a Web Server:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Makes content available online for users worldwide.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Provides stable access to resources and can handle multiple
                        requests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Allows configurations to optimize performance, security, and
                        functionality.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="note">In essence, a web server acts as the backbone of the internet, connecting users to the
                    content and
                    applications they need. Without web servers, online content delivery would not be possible.</p>

                        manage services like Apache and MySQL.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access:</strong> Once running, you can access the local server by typing
                        <code>localhost</code> or <code>127.0.0.1</code> in a browser.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Benefits of Using a Local Server:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Internet Required:</strong> Development can continue offline.</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Local development keeps projects private until they are ready for
                        deployment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Free to set up, with no hosting fees for local development.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="note">Local servers are invaluable for developers as they provide a risk-free environment to
                    test, debug, and improve applications before deploying them online.</p>

                <h2>How to Configure a PHP Environment</h2>
                <p>Configuring a PHP environment is essential for developing and testing PHP applications on your
                    computer. This guide will walk you through setting up and configuring PHP with essential tools and
                    configurations.</p>

                <h2>Step 1: Install PHP</h2>
                <p class="note">We already discussed about installing previously <a href="?s=6">See Here</a></p>

                <h2>Step 2: Configure PHP Environment Variables (Windows)</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open the System Properties by searching for "Environment Variables" in the Windows search bar.
                    </li>
                    <li>Edit the <strong>PATH</strong> variable and add the path to your PHP folder (e.g.,
                        <code>C:\php</code>).</li>
                    <li>Open a new command prompt and type <code>php -v</code> to confirm the installation.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Step 3: Configure the <code>php.ini</code> File</h2>
                <p>The <code>php.ini</code> file is the main configuration file for PHP. Here are some common
                    configurations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Enable Error Reporting:</strong> For development, enable error reporting by setting:
                        <pre><code>display_errors = On</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Set Timezone:</strong> Configure your timezone:
                        <pre><code>date.timezone = "America/New_York"</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Memory Limit:</strong> Set the maximum memory PHP can use:
                        <pre><code>memory_limit = 128M</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>File Uploads:</strong> Adjust the max file upload size if needed:
                        <pre><code>upload_max_filesize = 50M</code></pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step 4: Install and Configure a Web Server</h2>
                <p>PHP needs to run on a web server, such as Apache or Nginx:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Apache:</strong> If using WAMP or XAMPP, Apache is preconfigured. Add this to
                        <code>httpd.conf</code>:
                        <pre><code>LoadModule php_module "C:/php/php8apache2_4.dll"</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Nginx:</strong> Configure <code>nginx.conf</code> to point to your PHP processor.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step 5: Test Your PHP Environment</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a new file in your web server's root directory named <code>info.php</code>.</li>
                    <li>Add the following code to the file:
                        <pre><code>&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?></code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>Open a browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost/info.php</code> to see the PHP info page,
                        which confirms PHP is working.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Additional Tips:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Enable Extensions:</strong> Enable necessary extensions (e.g., MySQL, cURL) by
                        uncommenting them in <code>php.ini</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Restart Server:</strong> After making changes to <code>php.ini</code>, restart your
                        server to apply the configurations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Development vs. Production:</strong> Adjust configurations for security when moving to
                        production, such as setting <code>display_errors = Off</code>.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Following these steps will help you set up and configure a PHP environment for local development,
                    allowing you to build and test PHP applications efficiently.</p>

                <h1>Embedding PHP in a Web Page</h1>
                <p>PHP can be embedded within HTML to create dynamic web pages. PHP code is executed on the server, and
                    the resulting output is sent to the browser. This guide explains how to include PHP in an HTML
                    document.</p>

                <h2>Basic Syntax for Embedding PHP</h2>
                <p>PHP code is embedded within HTML using <code>&lt;?php ?&gt;</code> tags. Here’s a simple example:</p>
                <pre><code>&lt;?php echo "Hello, World!"; ?&gt;</code></pre>
                <p class="note">The above code will output "Hello, World!" to the web page when processed by the PHP server.</p>

                <h2>Example: Embedding PHP Within HTML</h2>
                <p>In practice, you can mix HTML and PHP code to display content dynamically. Here’s an example:</p>
                <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;PHP Embedded Page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Website&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s date is: &lt;?php echo date("l, F j, Y"); ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Here is a random number: &lt;?php echo rand(1, 100); ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
                <p>In this example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Date Display:</strong> PHP generates the current date using the <code>date()</code>
                        function.</li>
                    <li><strong>Random Number:</strong> PHP generates a random number with <code>rand()</code>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Using PHP for Conditional Content</h2>
                <p>You can also use PHP to show different content based on conditions. For example:</p>
                <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Welcome, &lt;?php
if (date("H") &lt; 12) {
    echo "Good Morning!";
} else {
    echo "Good Afternoon!";
}
?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

                <h2>Tips for Embedding PHP in Web Pages</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Save as .php:</strong> Make sure to save the file with a <code>.php</code> extension for
                        the server to process PHP code.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Echo for Output:</strong> PHP code can print text to the HTML output using
                        <code>echo</code> or <code>print</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Server Requirement:</strong> PHP code will only execute on a server configured to run
                        PHP (e.g., a WAMP, LAMP, or XAMPP server).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Embedding PHP in HTML allows you to create dynamic content, enhancing the functionality and
                    interactivity of web pages.</p>

    <h2>Examples of PHP Tokens in Code</h2>
    <p>Let’s look at a PHP code snippet to identify various tokens:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
$number = 10;        // $number and 10 are tokens
if ($number &gt; 5) { // if, $, &gt;, { are tokens
    echo "Greater";   // echo and "Greater" are tokens
}
?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>In this example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>if</code> is a keyword.</li>
        <li><code>$number</code> is an identifier.</li>
        <li><code>10</code> is a constant.</li>
        <li><code>&gt;</code> is an operator.</li>
        <li><code>{</code> and <code>}</code> are separators.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p class="note">PHP tokens form the building blocks of any PHP script, helping define the structure and logic. Recognizing and understanding these tokens makes it easier to write and interpret PHP code effectively.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Variables in PHP</h2>
    <p>In PHP, a variable is a container for storing data values. Variables are essential for managing information in a program, allowing you to store, manipulate, and retrieve data.</p>

    <h2>Defining Variables</h2>
    <p>Variables in PHP are defined using the dollar sign (<code>$</code>) followed by the variable name. The syntax is as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>$variableName = value;</code></pre>

    <h2>Variable Naming Rules</h2>
    <p>When naming variables, you must follow certain rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Must start with a letter or an underscore (<code>_</code>).</li>
        <li>Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.</li>
        <li>Cannot contain spaces or special characters.</li>
        <li>Case-sensitive (e.g., <code>$Var</code> and <code>$var</code> are different).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples of Variable Declaration</h2>
    <p>Here are some examples of variable declarations in PHP:</p>
    <pre><code>$name = "John";      // String variable
$age = 25;            // Integer variable
$height = 5.9;       // Float variable
$isStudent = true;   // Boolean variable</code></pre>

    <h2>Using Variables</h2>
    <p>Once defined, variables can be used in expressions, functions, and output. Here’s an example:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
$name = "Alice";
$age = 30;

echo "Name: " . $name . "&lt;br&gt;Age: " . $age; // Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30
?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Variable Scope</h2>
    <p>The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed within the code. PHP has three main variable scopes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Global:</strong> Variables defined outside functions and accessible globally.</li>
        <li><strong>Local:</strong> Variables defined within a function and accessible only within that function.</li>
        <li><strong>Static:</strong> Local variables that maintain their value between function calls.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">Read more about Variables Scope : <a href="?s=11">See Here</a></p>


    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">Variables are a fundamental concept in PHP, allowing developers to store and manipulate data effectively. Understanding how to declare, use, and manage variables is crucial for building dynamic PHP applications.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Variable Scope in PHP</h2>
                <p>Variable scope determines the visibility and lifetime of a variable within your PHP code. Understanding variable scope is crucial for effective programming and debugging.</p>
            
                <h2>Types of Variable Scope</h2>
                <p>PHP has three main types of variable scope:</p>
            
                <h3>1. Global Scope</h3>
                <p>Variables declared outside of any function or class have global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in the script, but not inside functions unless declared as global within the function:</p>
                <pre><code>&lt;?php
            $globalVar = "I am global"; // Global variable
            
            function testGlobal() {
                global $globalVar; // Declare global variable
                echo $globalVar;   // Access global variable
            }
            testGlobal(); // Output: I am global
            ?&gt;</code></pre>
            
                <h3>2. Local Scope</h3>
                <p>Variables declared inside a function have local scope. They can only be accessed within that function:</p>
                <pre><code>&lt;?php
            function testLocal() {
                $localVar = "I am local"; // Local variable
                echo $localVar; // Accessible within the function
            }
            testLocal(); // Output: I am local
            // echo $localVar; // This will cause an error since $localVar is not accessible here.
            ?&gt;</code></pre>
            
                <h3>3. Static Scope</h3>
                <p>Static variables retain their value even after the function has finished executing. They are declared using the <code>static</code> keyword:</p>
                <pre><code>&lt;?php
            function countCalls() {
                static $count = 0; // Static variable
                $count++;
                echo "This function has been called $count times.&lt;br&gt;";
            }
            
            countCalls(); // Output: This function has been called 1 times.
            countCalls(); // Output: This function has been called 2 times.
            ?&gt;</code></pre>
            
                <h2>Variable Scope and Superglobals</h2>
                <p>PHP also provides <strong>superglobals</strong>, which are built-in global arrays accessible from any scope. Common superglobals include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>$_GET</code></li>
                    <li><code>$_POST</code></li>
                    <li><code>$_SESSION</code></li>
                    <li><code>$_COOKIE</code></li>
                    <li><code>$_FILES</code></li>
                    <li><code>$_SERVER</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Superglobals can be accessed without the need for the <code>global</code> keyword.</p>
            
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p class="note">Understanding variable scope in PHP helps manage the visibility and lifespan of variables effectively. By recognizing the differences between global, local, and static scopes, as well as utilizing superglobals, you can write more efficient and organized PHP code.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Constants in PHP</h2>
    <p>A constant is a simple value that cannot be changed during the execution of a script. Constants are beneficial for defining values that remain unchanged throughout your application, enhancing code readability and maintainability.</p>

    <h2>Defining Constants</h2>
    <p>Constants in PHP can be defined using the <code>define()</code> function. The syntax is as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>define("CONSTANT_NAME", value);</code></pre>

    <h2>Examples of Defining Constants</h2>
    <p>Here are examples of defining constants:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
define("SITE_NAME", "My Awesome Website");
define("MAX_USERS", 100);
define("PI", 3.14159);
?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Using Constants</h2>
    <p>Once defined, constants can be used throughout your script. Unlike variables, constants do not require the dollar sign (<code>$</code>) prefix:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
echo "Welcome to " . SITE_NAME; // Output: Welcome to My Awesome Website
echo "&lt;br&gt;Maximum users allowed: " . MAX_USERS; // Output: Maximum users allowed: 100
?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Characteristics of Constants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Immutable:</strong> Once defined, the value of a constant cannot be changed.</li>
        <li><strong>Global Scope:</strong> Constants are automatically global across the entire script and can be accessed from any function or class.</li>
        <li><strong>No Dollar Sign:</strong> Constants do not require a dollar sign (<code>$</code>) when being used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Case Sensitivity</h2>
    <p>By default, constant names are case-sensitive. However, you can define a constant as case-insensitive by passing a third argument to the <code>define()</code> function:</p>
    <pre><code>define("MY_CONSTANT", "Value", true); // Case-insensitive constant</code></pre>
    <p>This allows you to access it using either <code>MY_CONSTANT</code> or <code>my_constant</code>.</p>

    <h2>Predefined Constants</h2>
    <p>PHP also provides a number of predefined constants that are built into the language, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>PHP_VERSION</code>: Current PHP version.</li>
        <li><code>PHP_OS</code>: Operating system PHP is running on.</li>
        <li><code>__LINE__</code>: Current line number of the file.</li>
        <li><code>__FILE__</code>: Full path and filename of the file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These constants can be used without any additional definition.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">Constants in PHP are a powerful feature that allows you to define immutable values for use throughout your script. They enhance code clarity and maintainability, making it easier to manage values that should remain constant during execution.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Data Types in PHP</h2>
    <p>Data types in PHP define the type of data a variable can hold. PHP is a loosely typed language, meaning you don’t need to declare a variable’s type explicitly; it automatically converts the type based on the value assigned. However, understanding data types is essential for effective programming and ensuring data integrity.</p>

    <h2>Basic Data Types</h2>
    <p>PHP has four main scalar data types and two compound data types:</p>

    <h3>1. Scalar Data Types</h3>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Data Type</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Example</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Integer</td>
                <td>Whole numbers without decimal points.</td>
                <td><code>42</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Float</td>
                <td>Numbers with decimal points.</td>
                <td><code>3.14</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>String</td>
                <td>A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.</td>
                <td><code>"Hello, World!"</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Boolean</td>
                <td>Represents two possible values: <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</td>
                <td><code>true</code></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>2. Compound Data Types</h3>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Data Type</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Example</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Array</td>
                <td>A collection of values of any data type.</td>
                <td><code>$fruits = array("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry");</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Object</td>
                <td>An instance of a class containing properties and methods.</td>
                <td><code>$myCar = new Car("red");</code></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Type Casting</h2>
    <p>PHP allows you to convert one data type into another using type casting. Here are some common examples:</p>
    <pre><code>$num = "10"; // String
$intValue = (int)$num; // Cast to Integer
$floatValue = (float)$num; // Cast to Float
</code></pre>

    <h2>Checking Data Types</h2>
    <p>You can check the data type of a variable using the <code>gettype()</code> function or the <code>var_dump()</code> function:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
$var = 42;
echo gettype($var); // Output: integer
var_dump($var); // Output: int(42)
?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Type Juggling</h2>
    <p>PHP automatically converts data types when necessary, a feature known as type juggling. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
$number = "10"; // String
$result = $number + 5; // Automatically converted to integer
echo $result; // Output: 15
?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">Understanding data types in PHP is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free code. While PHP's flexibility with types makes it easier to work with, knowing how to properly handle and convert data types will enhance your programming skills.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Comments in PHP</h2>
                <p>Comments in PHP are non-executable lines in the code. They are meant for documentation and explanation purposes, helping developers understand the code. Comments can explain what a section of code does, provide context, and clarify complex logic.</p>
            
                <h2>Types of Comments in PHP</h2>
                <p>PHP supports three types of comments:</p>
            
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>

                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Single-line Comment</td>
                            <td><code>//</code> or <code>#</code></td>
                            <td>Single-line comments start with <code>//</code> or <code>#</code> and continue to the end of the line.</td>
                            <td>
                                <code>// This is a single-line comment</code><br>
                                <code># Another single-line comment</code>
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Multi-line Comment</td>
                            <td><code>/* ... */</code></td>
                            <td>Multi-line comments start with <code>/*</code> and end with <code>*/</code>, allowing comments over multiple lines.</td>
                            <td>
                                <code>/*<br>
                                This is a<br>
                                multi-line comment<br>
                                */</code>
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            
                <h2>Using Comments in PHP Code</h2>
                <p>Comments are helpful in explaining the functionality and logic of the code. They are ignored by the PHP interpreter and do not affect the execution.</p>
                <p>Here’s how you might use comments in PHP:</p>
                <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // This is a single-line comment explaining the variable assignment
    $number = 10; 
    
    /*
    This is a multi-line comment.
    It explains a block of code in more detail.
    It can span multiple lines.
    */
    $result = $number * 2; // This calculates the doubled value
            
?&gt;</code></pre>
            
                <h2>Best Practices for Comments</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use comments to explain complex or non-intuitive code.</li>
                    <li>Avoid over-commenting simple or self-explanatory code.</li>
                    <li>Maintain consistency in comment style throughout your codebase.</li>
                    <li>Update comments if code changes to prevent outdated or incorrect explanations.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="note">Comments are essential for writing clear, understandable, and maintainable code. By using comments effectively, you can make your code more accessible to others and easier to understand over time.</p>

    <h2>Understanding echo in PHP</h2>
    <p>The <code>echo</code> statement in PHP is used to output text, variables, HTML markup, and other content to the web page. It is one of the most common ways to display information in PHP.</p>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <p>The syntax for <code>echo</code> is straight forward. Here is a basic example:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    echo "Hello, World!";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>This code will output the text <strong>Hello, World!</strong> to the browser.</p>

    <h2>Using echo with Variables</h2>
    <p>You can also use <code>echo</code> to display the value of variables. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $name = "John";
    echo "Hello, " . $name . "!";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>This will output <strong>Hello, John!</strong> by concatenating the variable <code>$name</code> with the string.</p>

    <h2>Combining HTML and echo</h2>
    <p>The <code>echo</code> statement can also output HTML content. For instance:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    echo "&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to my website!&lt;/h2&gt;";
    echo "&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>This PHP code will display an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> heading and a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> paragraph on the web page.</p>

    <h2>Using echo Without Parentheses</h2>
    <p>Unlike functions, <code>echo</code> does not require parentheses:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    echo "Hello, World!";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>However, if you prefer, you can also use parentheses:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    echo("Hello, World!");
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>Both methods work the same way.</p>

    <h2>Outputting Multiple Parameters</h2>
    <p>With <code>echo</code>, you can pass multiple arguments separated by commas:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    echo "Hello", " ", "World", "!";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>This will output <strong>Hello World!</strong>. Note that this only works with <code>echo</code> and not with <code>print</code>.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">The <code>echo</code> statement is a versatile and essential tool for displaying output in PHP. By combining <code>echo</code> with variables and HTML tags, you can create dynamic content for your web pages.</p>

            </section>
            <section class="phpcontent">

    <h2>Understanding the print Statement in PHP</h2>
    <p>The <code>print</code> statement in PHP is used to output text, variables, HTML markup, and other content to the web page. While similar to <code>echo</code>, <code>print</code> has some distinct characteristics.</p>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <p>The syntax for <code>print</code> is simple, and here is an example:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    print "Hello, World!";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>This code will output the text <strong>Hello, World!</strong> to the browser.</p>

    <h2>Difference Between echo and print</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>print</code> returns a value (1), so it can be used in expressions.</li>
        <li><code>echo</code> does not return a value.</li>
        <li><code>print</code> can only take one argument, while <code>echo</code> can take multiple arguments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Using print with Variables</h2>
    <p>Just like <code>echo</code>, <code>print</code> can display variables:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $name = "Alice";
    print "Hello, " . $name . "!";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>This will output <strong>Hello, Alice!</strong> by concatenating the variable <code>$name</code> with the string.</p>

    <h2>Combining HTML and print</h2>
    <p>The <code>print</code> statement can also output HTML content. For instance:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    print "&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to My Website!&lt;/h2&gt;";
    print "&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>This PHP code will display an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> heading and a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> paragraph on the web page.</p>

    <h2>Using print with Parentheses</h2>
    <p>Unlike functions, <code>print</code> does not require parentheses:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    print "Hello, World!";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>However, you can also use parentheses:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    print("Hello, World!");
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>Both methods work the same way.</p>

    <h2>Using print in Expressions</h2>
    <p>Since <code>print</code> returns a value, you can use it within expressions:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $result = (print "Hello!") + 5;
    print "&lt;p&gt;The result is $result&lt;/p&gt;";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>This will output <strong>Hello!</strong> followed by <strong>The result is 6</strong> since <code>print</code> returns 1.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">The <code>print</code> statement in PHP is useful for outputting text and variables, especially in cases where a return value is helpful. By understanding how to use <code>print</code>, you can display content dynamically on your PHP web pages.</p>

            <section class="phpcontent">

    <h2>Understanding Branching Statements in PHP</h2>
    <p>Branching statements, also known as conditional statements, allow your code to make decisions based on certain conditions. They are essential for creating dynamic behavior in PHP programs.</p>

    <h2>If Statement</h2>
    <p>The <code>if</code> statement checks a condition and executes code if the condition is true.</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $age = 18;

    if ($age >= 18) {
        echo "You are eligible to vote.";
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>In this example, if <code>$age</code> is 18 or greater, it will print <strong>You are eligible to vote.</strong>.</p>

    <h2>If-Else Statement</h2>
    <p>The <code>if-else</code> statement provides an alternative path if the <code>if</code> condition is false.</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $score = 75;

    if ($score >= 50) {
        echo "You passed.";
    } else {
        echo "You failed.";
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>If <code>$score</code> is 50 or higher, it will print <strong>You passed</strong>. Otherwise, it will print <strong>You failed</strong>.</p>

    <h2>If-Elseif-Else Statement</h2>
    <p>The <code>if-elseif-else</code> statement checks multiple conditions sequentially.</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $grade = 85;

    if ($grade >= 90) {
        echo "A";
    } elseif ($grade >= 80) {
        echo "B";
    } elseif ($grade >= 70) {
        echo "C";
    } else {
        echo "F";
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>This code checks each condition, outputting the grade based on the <code>$grade</code> value.</p>

    <h2>Switch Statement</h2>
    <p>The <code>switch</code> statement is useful for checking one variable against multiple possible values.</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $day = "Wednesday";

    switch ($day) {
        case "Monday":
            echo "Start of the week!";
            break;
        case "Wednesday":
            echo "Midweek day!";
            break;
        case "Friday":
            echo "Almost weekend!";
            break;
        default:
            echo "Have a nice day!";
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>This code will output <strong>Midweek day!</strong> since the value of <code>$day</code> is <code>Wednesday</code>.</p>

    <h2>Alternative Syntax for Control Structures</h2>
    <p>PHP also provides an alternative syntax for branching statements that’s often used in templates:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php if ($age >= 18): ?&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are eligible to vote.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;?php else: ?&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are not eligible to vote.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p class="note">This alternative syntax is helpful for readability, especially in HTML-heavy PHP files.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">Branching statements are essential for creating logic and decision-making in PHP programs. By using <code>if</code>, <code>if-else</code>, <code>if-elseif-else</code>, and <code>switch</code> statements, you can control the flow of your code based on specific conditions.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Looping Statements in PHP</h2>
    <p>Looping statements allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. In PHP, there are several types of loops, each useful in different scenarios.</p>

    <h2>while Loop</h2>
    <p>The <code>while</code> loop runs as long as a specified condition is true.</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $count = 1;
    while ($count &lt;= 5) {
        echo "Count: $count&lt;br&gt;";
        $count++;
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>This loop will output <strong>Count: 1</strong> to <strong>Count: 5</strong>, incrementing the count each time until the condition is no longer true.</p>

    <h2>do-while Loop</h2>
    <p>The <code>do-while</code> loop is similar to <code>while</code> but guarantees at least one execution of the code block.</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $count = 1;
    do {
        echo "Count: $count&lt;br&gt;";
        $count++;
    } while ($count &lt;= 5);
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>This loop also outputs <strong>Count: 1</strong> to <strong>Count: 5</strong>, but will always run at least once, even if the condition is initially false.</p>

    <h2>for Loop</h2>
    <p>The <code>for</code> loop is commonly used for a specific number of iterations, with a counter that is initialized, tested, and updated in one line.</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    for ($i = 1; $i &lt;= 5; $i++) {
        echo "Iteration: $i&lt;br&gt;";
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>This loop will output <strong>Iteration: 1</strong> to <strong>Iteration: 5</strong>, incrementing <code>$i</code> after each loop iteration.</p>

    <h2>foreach Loop</h2>
    <p>The <code>foreach</code> loop is designed to work with arrays, iterating over each element in the array.</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $colors = array("Red", "Green", "Blue");

    foreach ($colors as $color) {
        echo "Color: $color&lt;br&gt;";
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>This loop will output <strong>Color: Red</strong>, <strong>Color: Green</strong>, and <strong>Color: Blue</strong>, iterating over each element in the <code>$colors</code> array.</p>

    <h2>Loop Control Statements</h2>
    <p>PHP includes control statements to manage loop flow:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>break</code>: Exits the loop entirely.</li>
        <li><code>continue</code>: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Using break
    for ($i = 1; $i &lt;= 5; $i++) {
        if ($i == 3) break;
        echo "Iteration: $i&lt;br&gt;";
    }

    // Using continue
    for ($i = 1; $i &lt;= 5; $i++) {
        if ($i == 3) continue;
        echo "Iteration: $i&lt;br&gt;";
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>The first loop will stop at <strong>Iteration: 2</strong> due to <code>break</code>, and the second loop will skip <strong>Iteration: 3</strong> due to <code>continue</code>.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">Looping statements in PHP enable repetitive tasks, whether by using <code>while</code>, <code>do-while</code>, <code>for</code>, or <code>foreach</code>. Loop control statements like <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> offer additional flexibility for more complex tasks.</p>

    <h2>Introduction to Functions in PHP</h2>
    <p>Functions in PHP are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing and simplifying code, making it easier to maintain and debug.</p>

    <h2>What is a Function?</h2>
    <p>A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. Functions are executed only when they are called or invoked. PHP has many built-in functions, but you can also create your own.</p>

    <h2>Defining a Function</h2>
    <p>To define a function in PHP, use the <code>function</code> keyword, followed by the name of the function, parentheses, and curly braces:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    function sayHello() {
        echo "Hello, World!";
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>In this example, a function named <code>sayHello</code> is defined. It outputs <strong>Hello, World!</strong> when called.</p>

    <h2>Calling a Function</h2>
    <p>To call a function, simply use its name followed by parentheses:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    sayHello();
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Functions with Parameters</h2>
    <p>Functions can take parameters to accept input values. These parameters are specified in the parentheses:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    function greet($name) {
        echo "Hello, $name!";
    }

    greet("Alice"); 
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>In this example, the <code>greet</code> function takes one parameter, <code>$name</code>, and uses it in the output.</p>

    <h2>Functions with Multiple Parameters</h2>
    <p>Functions can have multiple parameters, separated by commas:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    function add($a, $b) {
        return $a + $b;
    }

    $result = add(5, 10); 
    echo "The sum is: $result";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>The <code>add</code> function takes two parameters, adds them, and returns the result.</p>

    <h2>Returning Values from a Function</h2>
    <p>Functions can return a value using the <code>return</code> keyword:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    function multiply($x, $y) {
        return $x * $y;
    }

    $product = multiply(3, 4); 
    echo "The product is: $product";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>The <code>multiply</code> function returns the product of <code>$x</code> and <code>$y</code>, which is then stored in <code>$product</code>.</p>

    <h2>Default Parameter Values</h2>
    <p>PHP functions can have default parameter values, which are used if no arguments are provided:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    function greet($name = "Guest") {
        echo "Hello, $name!";
    }

    greet(); 
    greet("Bob"); 
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>In this example, the <code>greet</code> function has a default value of <code>"Guest"</code> for the <code>$name</code> parameter.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">Functions in PHP are powerful tools that help make your code more efficient and manageable. By understanding how to define, call, and use functions with parameters and return values, you can build more dynamic and reusable code.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">These tables highlight some of the most frequently used predefined functions in PHP for handling strings, performing mathematical operations, and managing arrays. Each function helps simplify coding tasks significantly.</p>

            <section class="phpcontent">
                <h2>User-Defined Functions in PHP</h2>
    <p>In addition to using built-in functions, PHP allows developers to create their own functions, called user-defined functions. These functions make your code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain.</p>

    <h2>Syntax of a User-Defined Function</h2>
    <p>A user-defined function in PHP is declared using the <code>function</code> keyword, followed by the function name and a set of parentheses. Here’s the basic syntax:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    function functionName() {
        // Code to be executed
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Examples of User-Defined Functions</h2>

    <h3>Simple Function</h3>
    <p>This function prints a greeting message:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    function sayHello() {
        echo "Hello, World!";
    }

    sayHello(); // Outputs: Hello, World!
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h3>Function with Parameters</h3>
    <p>This function accepts parameters and prints a personalized greeting:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    function greet($name) {
        echo "Hello, $name!";
    }

    greet("Alice"); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!
    greet("Bob");   // Outputs: Hello, Bob!
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h3>Function with Return Value</h3>
    <p>This function calculates the sum of two numbers and returns the result:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    function add($a, $b) {
        return $a + $b;
    }

    $result = add(5, 10);
    echo "The sum is: " . $result; // Outputs: The sum is: 15
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h3>Function with Default Parameters</h3>
    <p>This function has a default value for one of its parameters:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    function greetWithDefault($name = "Guest") {
        echo "Hello, $name!";
    }

    greetWithDefault();        // Outputs: Hello, Guest!
    greetWithDefault("Charlie"); // Outputs: Hello, Charlie!
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">User-defined functions in PHP are powerful tools that help structure your code more efficiently. They are especially useful when you need to perform the same operation multiple times in a program.</p>

    <h2>Recursion in PHP</h2>
    <p>Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It is useful for problems that can be broken down into simpler, identical sub-problems.</p>

    <h2>How Recursion Works</h2>
    <p>A recursive function must have a termination condition to prevent infinite loops. This condition, called the base case, stops the function from calling itself when a certain condition is met.</p>

    <h2>Example: Factorial Function</h2>
    <p>One common example of a recursive function is calculating the factorial of a number. The factorial of <code>n</code> (denoted as <code>n!</code>) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to <code>n</code>. It is defined as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>0! = 1</code></li>
        <li><code>n! = n * (n - 1)!</code> for <code>n &gt; 0</code></li>
    </ul>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    function factorial($n) {
        if ($n === 0) {
            return 1; // Base case
        } else {
            return $n * factorial($n - 1); // Recursive call
        }
    }

    echo "Factorial of 5 is: " . factorial(5); // Outputs: 120
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Example: Fibonacci Sequence</h2>
    <p>The Fibonacci sequence is another classic example of recursion. The sequence is defined as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>F(0) = 0</code></li>
        <li><code>F(1) = 1</code></li>
        <li><code>F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)</code> for <code>n &gt; 1</code></li>
    </ul>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    function fibonacci($n) {
        if ($n === 0) {
            return 0; // Base case
        } elseif ($n === 1) {
            return 1; // Base case
        } else {
            return fibonacci($n - 1) + fibonacci($n - 2); // Recursive call
        }
    }

    echo "Fibonacci of 6 is: " . fibonacci(6); // Outputs: 8
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of Recursion</h2>
    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Simplifies code for problems that have a natural recursive structure, such as tree traversal and mathematical sequences.</li>
        <li>Easy to write and understand for problems that are inherently recursive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Can be less efficient and use more memory due to the overhead of function calls.</li>
        <li>Risk of stack overflow if the recursion depth is too large.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">Recursion is a powerful tool in PHP, but it should be used with caution. For problems that can be solved iteratively, using loops may be more efficient. However, for problems like traversing hierarchical structures, recursion is often the most natural and elegant solution.</p>

                <h2>Introduction to Strings in PHP</h2>
    <p>In PHP, a string is a sequence of characters used to store and manipulate text. Strings can be created using single quotes or double quotes, and they can include letters, numbers, symbols, or even whitespace.</p>

    <h2>Creating Strings</h2>
    <p>Strings can be declared in two main ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Single quotes: <code>'This is a string'</code></li>
        <li>Double quotes: <code>"This is another string"</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Using single quotes
    $string1 = 'Hello, World!';

    // Using double quotes
    $string2 = "Hello, PHP!";

    // Displaying strings
    echo $string1; // Outputs: Hello, World!
    echo "&lt;br&gt;";
    echo $string2; // Outputs: Hello, PHP!
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>String Concatenation</h2>
    <p>In PHP, you can join two or more strings using the concatenation operator <code>.</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $firstName = "John";
    $lastName = "Doe";
    $fullName = $firstName . " " . $lastName;

    echo $fullName; // Outputs: John Doe
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Escaping Characters</h2>
    <p>When using single or double quotes, you may need to escape certain characters. This is done using a backslash <code>\</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Using single quotes with escape characters
    $string = 'It\'s a sunny day!'; // Escapes the single quote

    // Using double quotes with escape characters
    $quote = "He said, \"Hello, World!\""; // Escapes the double quotes

    echo $string; // Outputs: It's a sunny day!
    echo "&lt;br&gt;";
    echo $quote;  // Outputs: He said, "Hello, World!"
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">Strings are a fundamental part of PHP programming, used in almost every application. Understanding how to work with strings and use built-in string functions is essential for handling and manipulating text efficiently.</p>

    <h2>String Interpolation in PHP</h2>
    <p>String interpolation in PHP allows variables to be embedded directly within double-quoted strings, making it easier to construct complex strings. This feature works only with double quotes and not with single quotes.</p>

    <h2>Syntax of String Interpolation</h2>
    <p>When using double quotes, PHP automatically parses variables and replaces them with their values:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $name = "Alice";
    echo "Hello, $name!"; // Outputs: Hello, Alice!
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Using Curly Braces for Complex Expressions</h2>
    <p>To handle more complex expressions or when embedding an array element, curly braces <code>{}</code> can be used:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $fruit = "apple";
    echo "I have an {$fruit}s."; // Outputs: I have apples.

    $items = ["pen", "notebook", "eraser"];
    echo "I bought a {$items[1]}."; // Outputs: I bought a notebook.
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Difference Between Single and Double Quotes</h2>
    <p>String interpolation works with double quotes but not with single quotes. Single quotes treat variables as plain text:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $color = "blue";

    echo "The sky is $color.";  // Outputs: The sky is blue.
    echo '&lt;br&gt;';
    echo 'The sky is $color.';  // Outputs: The sky is $color.
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Example of String Interpolation</h2>
    <p>Here’s a simple example that demonstrates how string interpolation can be used to construct dynamic messages:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $user = "Bob";
    $age = 25;
    echo "Hello, $user! You are $age years old."; // Outputs: Hello, Bob! You are 25 years old.
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Interpolation with Array Elements</h2>
    <p>Interpolation can also be used with elements of an array:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
    echo "My favorite color is {$colors[2]}."; // Outputs: My favorite color is blue.
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">String interpolation in PHP is a simple and effective way to include variable values within strings. It is particularly useful for making code cleaner and easier to understand, especially when dealing with dynamic text.</p>

            <section class="phpcontent">

    <h2>String Operators in PHP</h2>
    <p>In PHP, there are several operators specifically designed for working with strings. The most commonly used string operators are concatenation and string comparison operators.</p>

    <h2>Concatenation Operator</h2>
    <p>The concatenation operator <code>.</code> is used to combine two or more strings into one. You can concatenate strings using this operator as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $string1 = "Hello, ";
    $string2 = "world!";
    $result = $string1 . $string2;

    echo $result; // Outputs: Hello, world!
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Concatenation Assignment Operator</h2>
    <p>PHP also provides a concatenation assignment operator <code>.=</code> which appends a string to an existing string variable:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $message = "Hello";
    $message .= ", world!";
    echo $message; // Outputs: Hello, world!
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>String Comparison Operators</h2>
    <p>PHP includes comparison operators that can be used to compare strings. The following operators are commonly used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>==</code>: Checks if two strings are equal.</li>
        <li><code>===</code>: Checks if two strings are identical (equal and of the same type).</li>
        <li><code>!=</code>: Checks if two strings are not equal.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;&gt;</code>: Checks if two strings are not equal (alternative to <code>!=</code>).</li>
        <li><code>&lt;</code>: Checks if one string is less than another.</li>
        <li><code>&gt;</code>: Checks if one string is greater than another.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example of String Comparison</h2>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $stringA = "apple";
    $stringB = "banana";

    if ($stringA == $stringB) {
        echo "$stringA is equal to $stringB.";
    } else {
        echo "$stringA is not equal to $stringB."; // Outputs: apple is not equal to banana.
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Case Sensitivity in Comparisons</h2>
    <p>String comparisons in PHP are case-sensitive. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $stringC = "Hello";
    $stringD = "hello";

    if ($stringC === $stringD) {
        echo "Strings are identical.";
    } else {
        echo "Strings are not identical."; // Outputs: Strings are not identical.
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">String operators in PHP are essential for manipulating and comparing text. The concatenation operator allows you to build strings dynamically, while comparison operators enable you to check equality and order of strings effectively.</p>

            </section>
            <section class="phpcontent">

    <h2>Heredoc in PHP</h2>
    <p>Heredoc is a syntax for defining multi-line strings in PHP. It allows you to create strings that span multiple lines without the need for concatenation. Heredoc syntax is particularly useful for embedding large blocks of text, such as HTML or documentation, within your PHP code.</p>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <p>The basic syntax for a Heredoc string is as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $variableName = &lt;&lt;&lt;EOT
    This is a Heredoc string.
    It can span multiple lines.
    You can include variables like $variable directly in it.
    EOT;
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Example of Using Heredoc</h2>
    <p>Here is an example that demonstrates how to use Heredoc to create a multi-line string:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $name = "Alice";
    $heredocString = &lt;&lt;&lt;EOT
    Hello, $name!
    Welcome to the world of PHP.
    This string spans multiple lines.
    EOT;

    echo $heredocString;
    /* Outputs:
    Hello, Alice!
    Welcome to the world of PHP.
    This string spans multiple lines.
    */
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Important Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The identifier used to start and end the Heredoc (e.g., <code>EOT</code>) can be any valid label, but it must match at both the start and end.</li>
        <li>There should be no spaces or tabs before the identifier on the closing line.</li>
        <li>Variables within a Heredoc are parsed, similar to double-quoted strings.</li>
        <li>Heredoc can also include special characters without needing to escape them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Using Heredoc with HTML</h2>
    <p>Heredoc is especially useful when embedding HTML code:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php

    <h2>Introduction to Arrays in PHP</h2>
    <p>Arrays in PHP are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They are a powerful data structure that allows you to work with lists of data efficiently.</p>

    <h2>What is an Array?</h2>
    <p>An array is a collection of elements, where each element can be accessed using an index. PHP supports both indexed arrays and associative arrays:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Indexed Arrays:</strong> Arrays with numeric indices, starting from 0.</li>
        <li><strong>Associative Arrays:</strong> Arrays with named keys, where each key is associated with a value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Creating Arrays</h2>
    <p>You can create arrays in PHP using the <code>array()</code> function or the shorthand <code>[]</code> syntax:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Indexed array
    $colors = array("Red", "Green", "Blue");
    $fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];

    // Associative array
    $ages = array("Alice" => 25, "Bob" => 30, "Charlie" => 35);
    $scores = ["Math" => 90, "Science" => 85, "English" => 95];
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Accessing Array Elements</h2>
    <p>To access elements in an array, you use the index or key:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Accessing elements in an indexed array
    echo $colors[0]; // Outputs: Red
    echo $fruits[2]; // Outputs: Orange

    // Accessing elements in an associative array
    echo $ages["Alice"]; // Outputs: 25
    echo $scores["Science"]; // Outputs: 85
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Modifying Arrays</h2>
    <p>You can add or change elements in an array using their index or key:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Adding elements to an indexed array
    $colors[] = "Yellow";
    $fruits[1] = "Mango"; // Modifies the second element

    // Adding elements to an associative array
    $ages["David"] = 40;
    $scores["History"] = 88;
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">Arrays are essential for managing lists of data in PHP, whether you are dealing with simple lists or complex collections of key-value pairs. Mastering arrays is crucial for effective programming in PHP.</p>

            </section>
            <section class="phpcontent">

    <h2>Types of Arrays in PHP</h2>
    <p>PHP supports three main types of arrays:</p>

    <h2>1. Indexed Arrays</h2>
    <p>Indexed arrays use numeric indices to access their elements. The index starts from 0 for the first element and increases by 1 for each subsequent element.</p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Creating an indexed array
    $colors = array("Red", "Green", "Blue");
    $fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];

    // Accessing elements
    echo $colors[0]; // Outputs: Red
    echo $fruits[2]; // Outputs: Orange
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>2. Associative Arrays</h2>
    <p>Associative arrays use named keys to access their elements. Each key is associated with a value, allowing for more descriptive data access.</p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Creating an associative array
    $ages = array("Alice" => 25, "Bob" => 30, "Charlie" => 35);
    $scores = ["Math" => 90, "Science" => 85, "English" => 95];

    // Accessing elements
    echo $ages["Alice"]; // Outputs: 25
    echo $scores["Science"]; // Outputs: 85
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>3. Multidimensional Arrays</h2>
    <p>Multidimensional arrays are arrays that contain other arrays as their elements. They can be used to represent more complex data structures, like a table of data or a matrix.</p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Creating a two-dimensional array
    $students = array(
        array("Name" => "Alice", "Age" => 25, "Grade" => "A"),
        array("Name" => "Bob", "Age" => 30, "Grade" => "B"),
        array("Name" => "Charlie", "Age" => 35, "Grade" => "C")
    );

    // Accessing elements
    echo $students[0]["Name"]; // Outputs: Alice
    echo $students[1]["Grade"]; // Outputs: B
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">Arrays in PHP come in different forms, allowing you to choose the most suitable structure based on your data requirements. Understanding indexed, associative, and multidimensional arrays is fundamental for effective data manipulation in PHP.</p>

            <section class="phpcontent">

    <h1>Inspecting Arrays in PHP</h1>
    <p>When working with arrays in PHP, you often need to inspect them to understand their structure and contents. PHP provides several functions to help with this.</p>

    <h2>1. <code>print_r()</code></h2>
    <p>The <code>print_r()</code> function displays the structure and contents of an array in a human-readable format. It is especially useful for debugging purposes.</p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $fruits = array("Apple", "Banana", "Orange");
    print_r($fruits);
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
<h3>Output:</h3>
<pre>
Array
 (
    [0] => Apple
    [1] => Banana
    [2] => Orange
 )
</pre>

    <h2>2. <code>var_dump()</code></h2>
    <p>The <code>var_dump()</code> function provides detailed information about an array, including the type and length of each element. It is more comprehensive than <code>print_r()</code>.</p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $ages = array("Alice" => 25, "Bob" => 30, "Charlie" => 35);
    var_dump($ages);
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

<h3>Output:</h3>
<pre>
array(3) {
    ["Alice"]=> int(25)
    ["Bob"]=> int(30)
    ["Charlie"]=> int(35)
}
</pre>

    <h2>3. <code>var_export()</code></h2>
    <p>The <code>var_export()</code> function returns a parsable string representation of an array. It is similar to <code>print_r()</code> but can be used to recreate the array.</p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $scores = array("Math" => 90, "Science" => 85, "English" => 95);
    var_export($scores);
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
<h3>Output:</h3>
<pre>
array(
    'Math' => 90,
    'Science' => 85,
    'English' => 95,
)
</pre>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">Using functions like <code>print_r()</code>, <code>var_dump()</code>, and <code>var_export()</code> can greatly aid in debugging and understanding the contents and structure of arrays in PHP. Choose the function that best suits your debugging needs.</p>

                <h2>4. Using <code>do-while</code> Loop</h2>
                <p>The <code>do-while</code> loop is similar to the <code>while</code> loop but guarantees that the loop will run at least once.</p>
                <h3>Example:</h3>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
    $numbers = array(1, 2, 3);
    $i = 0;
    
    do {
        echo $numbers[$i] . "&lt;br&gt;";
        $i++;
    } while ($i &lt; count($numbers));
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
  <h3>Output:</h3>
<pre>
    1
    2
    3
</pre>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="note">PHP provides multiple ways to iterate through arrays, each suited for different situations. The <code>foreach</code> loop is the most common and user-friendly for working with arrays, while <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops offer more control over the iteration process.</p>

    <h2>Super Global Variables in PHP</h2>
    <p>Super Global Variables in PHP are built-in variables that are available in all scopes throughout a script. They are initialized by PHP and can be used anywhere in your script.</p>

    <h2>List of Super Global Variables</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>$_GLOBALS</code>: References all variables available in global scope.</li>
        <li><code>$_SERVER</code>: Contains information about the server and environment.</li>
        <li><code>$_REQUEST</code>: Contains data from <code>$_GET</code>, <code>$_POST</code>, and <code>$_COOKIE</code>.</li>
        <li><code>$_POST</code>: Used to collect form data sent via HTTP POST.</li>
        <li><code>$_GET</code>: Used to collect form data sent via HTTP GET.</li>
        <li><code>$_FILES</code>: Used to manage file uploads.</li>
        <li><code>$_ENV</code>: Contains environment variables.</li>
        <li><code>$_COOKIE</code>: Contains cookie variables.</li>
        <li><code>$_SESSION</code>: Contains session variables.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples of Super Global Variables</h2>

    <h3>1. Using <code>$_SERVER</code></h3>
    <p><code>$_SERVER</code> contains information like headers, paths, and script locations.</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    echo "Server Name: " . $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] . "&lt;br&gt;";
    echo "Server Address: " . $_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'] . "&lt;br&gt;";
    echo "Request Method: " . $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] . "&lt;br&gt;";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h3>2. Using <code>$_GET</code> and <code>$_POST</code></h3>
    <p>These variables are used to collect data from forms. <code>$_GET</code> retrieves data sent with a GET request, and <code>$_POST</code> retrieves data sent with a POST request.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Form using <code>$_POST</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;form method="post"&gt;
    Name: &lt;input type="text" name="name"&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit"&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;

    &lt;?php
    if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
        $name = $_POST['name'];
        echo "Hello, " . htmlspecialchars($name);
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h3>3. Using <code>$_SESSION</code></h3>
    <p>Sessions store user information to be used across multiple pages.</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    session_start();
    $_SESSION['username'] = "JohnDoe";
    echo "Session username is: " . $_SESSION['username'];
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">Super Global Variables are essential for handling form data, managing sessions, accessing server information, and more. Understanding how to use them effectively will help you build robust PHP applications.</p>

    <h2>Importing User Input in PHP</h2>
    <p>In PHP, you can collect input from users through forms. This input can be imported using several super global arrays such as <code>$_GET</code>, <code>$_POST</code>, and <code>$_REQUEST</code>. Each of these arrays has different use cases for handling user-submitted data.</p>

    <h2>1. Using <code>$_GET</code> to Collect Data</h2>
    <p><code>$_GET</code> is used to collect data sent via the HTTP GET method. Data is passed as query parameters in the URL.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> URL: <code>example.php?name=John&age=25</code></p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    echo "Name: " . $_GET['name'];  // Outputs: John
    echo "&lt;br&gt;";
    echo "Age: " . $_GET['age'];    // Outputs: 25
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>2. Using <code>$_POST</code> to Collect Data</h2>
    <p><code>$_POST</code> is used to collect data sent via the HTTP POST method, typically from an HTML form. Data is not visible in the URL.</p>
    <p><strong>HTML Form using POST:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>&lt;form method="POST"&gt;
    Name: &lt;input type="text" name="name"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Age: &lt;input type="text" name="age"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Processing the Form Data with <code>$_POST</code>:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>&lt;?php
    if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
        $name = $_POST['name'];
        $age = $_POST['age'];
        echo "Name: $name&lt;br&gt;";
        echo "Age: $age&lt;br&gt;";
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>3. Using <code>$_REQUEST</code> to Collect Data</h2>
    <p><code>$_REQUEST</code> is a combination of <code>$_GET</code>, <code>$_POST</code>, and <code>$_COOKIE</code> data. It can collect data from any method (GET, POST, or COOKIE).</p>
    <p><strong>Example using <code>$_REQUEST</code>:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>&lt;form method="POST"&gt;
    Name: &lt;input type="text" name="name"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Age: &lt;input type="text" name="age"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Processing the Form Data with <code>$_REQUEST</code>:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
        $name = $_REQUEST['name'];
        $age = $_REQUEST['age'];
        echo "Name: $name&lt;br&gt;";
        echo "Age: $age&lt;br&gt;";
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>4. Importing Data from a URL</h2>
    <p>If you pass data via the URL using <code>?name=John&age=25</code>, you can retrieve it with <code>$_GET</code>. However, if the data is passed using the POST method, <code>$_POST</code> is used.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Collecting data via GET (URL) and POST (form submission).</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "GET") {
        $name = $_GET['name'];
        echo "Name from GET: $name&lt;br&gt;";
    }
    if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
        $name = $_POST['name'];
        echo "Name from POST: $name&lt;br&gt;";
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">PHP provides multiple methods for importing user input, including the <code>$_GET</code>, <code>$_POST</code>, and <code>$_REQUEST</code> superglobal arrays. Choosing the appropriate method depends on how you want to send and process the data in your web applications.</p>

                <h2>Connecting to a Database in PHP</h2>
                <p>In PHP, you can connect to a MySQL database using the <code>mysqli</code> extension or <code>PDO</code> (PHP Data Objects). Here, we'll focus on the <code>mysqli</code> extension.</p>
            
                <h2>Step 1: Database Configuration</h2>
                <p>Before you begin, ensure that you have a MySQL database and the necessary credentials:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Host</strong>: Typically 'localhost' if running locally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Username</strong>: The username for accessing the database (e.g., 'root').</li>
                    <li><strong>Password</strong>: The password associated with the username.</li>
                    <li><strong>Database Name</strong>: The name of the database you want to connect to.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>Step 2: PHP Code to Connect to the Database</h2>
                <p>The following PHP code shows how to connect to a MySQL database using the <code>mysqli_connect()</code> function.</p>
            
                <pre><code>&lt;?php
            
    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "root";
    $password = "";

    $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

    if ($conn->connect_error) {
        die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
    }
    echo "Connected successfully to the database";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
            
                <h2>Step 3: Check for Connection Errors</h2>
                <p>Always check for connection errors to handle potential issues, such as incorrect credentials or unreachable database server. If the connection fails, an error message is displayed.</p>
            
                <pre><code>&lt;?php
    if ($conn->connect_error) {
        die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
            
                <h2>Step 4: Closing the Connection</h2>
                <p>After you have finished interacting with the database, it's important to close the connection to free up resources.</p>
            
                <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $conn->close();
  ?&gt;</code></pre>
            
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <h2>Making SQL Queries in PHP</h2>
    <p>In PHP, you can interact with a MySQL database by executing SQL queries using the <code>mysqli</code> extension. The queries can be used to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data in the database.</p>

    <h2>1. SELECT Query</h2>
    <p>The <code>SELECT</code> query is used to retrieve data from the database.</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "root";
    $password = "";
    $dbname = "mydatabase";

    $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

    $sql = "SELECT id, name, age FROM users";
    $result = $conn->query($sql);

    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
        // Output data of each row
        while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
            echo "id: " . $row["id"]. " - Name: " . $row["name"]. " - Age: " . $row["age"]. "&lt;br&gt;";
        }
    } else {
        echo "0 results";
    }

    $conn->close();
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>2. INSERT Query</h2>
    <p>The <code>INSERT</code> query is used to insert new records into a table.</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "root";
    $password = "";
    $dbname = "mydatabase";

    <h2>Integrating Forms and Databases in PHP</h2>
    <p>This example demonstrates how to create an HTML form to collect user input, then insert that input into a MySQL database using PHP.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Create the Database Table</h2>
    <p>Before integrating the form, ensure you have a MySQL database and a table to store the data. Below is an SQL query to create a `users` table.</p>

    <pre><code>CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT(6) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT(3) NOT NULL
);</code></pre>

    <h2>Step 2: Create the HTML Form</h2>
    <p>The following HTML form collects the name and age of a user:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;form method="POST" action="insert.php"&gt;
    &lt;label for="name"&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" id="name" name="name" required&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;label for="age"&gt;Age:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="number" id="age" name="age" required&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Step 3: PHP Script to Insert Data into Database</h2>
    <p>When the user submits the form, the data is sent to a PHP script (in this case, `insert.php`) using the POST method. Below is the PHP code for `insert.php`:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "root";
    $password = "";
    $dbname = "mydatabase";

    $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

    if ($conn->connect_error) {
        die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
    }

    $name = $_POST['name'];
    $age = $_POST['age'];

    $sql = "INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('$name', '$age')";

    if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
        echo "New record created successfully";
    } else {
        echo "Error: " . $sql . "&lt;br&gt;" . $conn->error;
    }

    $conn->close();
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Step 4: Form Submission and Data Insertion</h2>
    <p>When the form is submitted, the data is sent to the PHP script using the POST method. The script processes the input, inserts it into the `users` table, and provides feedback to the user:</p>

    <pre><code>New record created successfully</code></pre>

    <h2>Security Considerations: SQL Injection Prevention</h2>
    <p>To protect your application from SQL injection attacks, you should use prepared statements or parameterized queries instead of directly inserting user input into the SQL query. Here's an updated example using prepared statements:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "root";
    $password = "";
    $dbname = "mydatabase";

    $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

    if ($conn->connect_error) {
        die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
    }

    $name = $_POST['name'];
    $age = $_POST['age'];

    $stmt = $conn->prepare("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)");
    $stmt->bind_param("si", $name, $age);  // "si" means string and integer

    if ($stmt->execute()) {
        echo "New record created successfully";
    } else {
        echo "Error: " . $stmt->error;
    }

    $stmt->close();
    $conn->close();
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">By using an HTML form and PHP, you can collect user input and store it in a MySQL database. This process involves creating the form, sending the data to a PHP script, and using SQL queries to insert the data into the database. Always remember to secure your application by using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.</p>

    <h2>Working with Cookies in PHP</h2>
    <p>In PHP, cookies are small pieces of data stored on the user's browser. They are commonly used for tracking user sessions, storing user preferences, or any other small data that should persist across pages or visits.</p>

    <h2>1. Setting a Cookie</h2>
    <p>You can set a cookie using the <code>setcookie()</code> function. The syntax is:</p>
    
    <pre><code>setcookie(name, value, expire, path, domain, secure, httponly);</code></pre>

    <p>Here's an example of how to set a cookie:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Set a cookie named "user" with value "John Doe" that expires in 1 hour
    setcookie("user", "John Doe", time() + 3600, "/"); // 3600 = 1 hour
    echo "Cookie has been set!";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>2. Retrieving a Cookie</h2>
    <p>To retrieve the value of a cookie, use the <code>$_COOKIE</code> superglobal array. Here's an example:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    if(isset($_COOKIE["user"])) {
        echo "User cookie value: " . $_COOKIE["user"];
    } else {
        echo "Cookie named 'user' is not set!";
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>3. Deleting a Cookie</h2>
    <p>To delete a cookie, you can set its expiration time to a past time. This will instruct the browser to remove it. Here's how to delete the "user" cookie:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Set the cookie to expire in the past to delete it
    setcookie("user", "", time() - 3600, "/");
    echo "Cookie has been deleted!";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>4. Cookie Expiration</h2>
    <p>The expiration time is important because it determines how long the cookie will last. If the expiration time is not set, the cookie will be a session cookie, which means it will expire once the browser is closed. Here's an example of setting a cookie that expires in 30 days:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Set a cookie with a 30-day expiration time
    setcookie("user", "Jane Doe", time() + (30 * 24 * 60 * 60), "/"); // 30 days
    echo "Cookie with 30 days expiration has been set!";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>5. Important Notes on Cookies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The <code>setcookie()</code> function must be called before any output (like HTML or echo statements) is sent to the browser. Otherwise, the cookie won't be set.</li>
        <li>Cookies are sent to the server with every HTTP request, so they can affect the performance of your website if too many cookies are used.</li>
        <li>Cookies are stored in the user's browser, so they can be cleared by the user at any time.</li>
        <li>For security reasons, always use <code>httponly</code> and <code>secure</code> flags when using cookies to store sensitive information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">Cookies are a useful tool for storing small pieces of data on the user's browser. They allow for persistent data storage and can be used for things like tracking sessions or storing preferences. However, it's important to use them securely and ensure that sensitive information is not stored in cookies without proper safeguards.</p>

    <h2>Working with Sessions in PHP</h2>
    <p>In PHP, sessions are used to store user data across multiple pages. Unlike cookies, session data is stored on the server, and only a session ID is stored in the user's browser. Sessions are commonly used to maintain user login states, shopping cart information, and other user-specific data.</p>

    <h2>1. Starting a Session</h2>
    <p>To begin using sessions in PHP, you must call <code>session_start()</code> at the top of your PHP file, before any HTML output. This function creates or resumes a session.</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Start the session
    session_start();
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>2. Storing Data in a Session</h2>
    <p>You can store data in a session using the <code>$_SESSION</code> superglobal array. Here's how to store a user's name in a session:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Start the session
    session_start();

    // Store data in session
    $_SESSION['username'] = 'John Doe';

    echo "Session data has been stored!";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>3. Accessing Session Data</h2>
    <p>You can access session data on any page after starting the session with <code>session_start()</code>. Here's an example of accessing and displaying the stored username:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Start the session
    session_start();

    // Check if the session variable is set
    if(isset($_SESSION['username'])) {
        echo "Hello, " . $_SESSION['username'];
    } else {
        echo "No session data found!";
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>4. Modifying Session Data</h2>
    <p>To modify session data, simply assign a new value to the session variable:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Start the session
    session_start();

    // Modify the session data
    $_SESSION['username'] = 'Jane Doe';

    echo "Session data has been updated!";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>5. Destroying a Session</h2>
    <p>If you want to remove a specific session variable, use <code>unset()</code>. To destroy the entire session (removing all session data), use <code>session_destroy()</code>.</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Start the session
    session_start();

    // Destroy a specific session variable
    unset($_SESSION['username']);

    // Destroy the entire session
    session_destroy();

    echo "Session has been destroyed!";
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>6. Session Expiration</h2>
    <p>Sessions do not have an expiration time by default, but you can control the session lifetime by adjusting the session cookie parameters or manually destroying the session after a certain period. Here's how you can set a session timeout:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?php
    // Start the session
    session_start();

    // Set the session timeout to 30 minutes
    $timeout_duration = 1800; // 30 minutes

    if (isset($_SESSION['last_activity']) && (time() - $_SESSION['last_activity']) > $timeout_duration) {
        // If the session has expired, destroy the session
        session_unset();     // Unset $_SESSION variable
        session_destroy();   // Destroy session data
        echo "Session expired!";
    } else {
        $_SESSION['last_activity'] = time(); // Update the last activity time
    }
  ?&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>7. Important Notes on Sessions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sessions are stored on the server, while a unique session ID is stored in the user's browser as a cookie (by default).</li>
        <li>The <code>session_start()</code> function must be called at the beginning of the PHP script before any HTML output is sent to the browser.</li>
        <li>Session data is temporary and will be lost once the user closes the browser, unless you set the session to persist across multiple visits by configuring session parameters.</li>
        <li>Always call <code>session_destroy()</code> to clear the session data after the user logs out or when it's no longer needed.</li>
        <li>Session data can be accessed across different pages as long as the session is active.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="note">Sessions provide a convenient way to store and access user-specific data across multiple pages. By using PHP sessions, you can manage things like user authentication, preferences, and any temporary data that needs to be shared across different parts of your website. Always remember to properly manage session data and destroy sessions when they are no longer needed for security reasons.</p>
